=head1 NAME

Web::XPath::Parser - An XPath parser

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Web::XPath::Parser> module contains an XPath parser, i.e. a
processor to convert XPath string into its internal data structure
representation.

=head1 METHODS

Following methods are available:

=over 4

=item $parser = Web::XPath::Parser->new

Return a new instance of the parser.

=item $code = $parser->onerror

=item $parser->onerror ($new_code)

Get or set the error handler for the parser.  Any parse error, as well
as warning and information, is reported to the handler.  See
L<Whatpm::Errors>
<https://github.com/wakaba/manakai/blob/master/lib/Whatpm/Errors.pod>
for more information.

=item $parsed = $parser->parse_char_string_as_expression ($string)

Parse the specified character string as an XPath 1.0 expression.  If
the parsing does not fail, it returns the parsed data structure.  If
the parsing fails, it reports the parse errors via the C<onerror>
handler and returns C<undef>.

=back

The parser does not examine whether the input string does not contain
non-Unicode character (i.e. U-00110000) for performance reason.  If
your application would like to fully conform to relevant standards,
you have to ensure that the input does not contain any character
greater than U+10FFFF before invoking the parser.

=head1 SPECIFICATIONS

=item XPATH1

XML Path Language (XPath) Version 1.0 <http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/>.

XML Path Language (XPath) Version 1.0 Specification Errata
<http://www.w3.org/1999/11/REC-xpath-19991116-errata/>.

The C<NCName> production rule in the Namespaces in XML 1.0 (Second
Edition) <http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-names-20060816/#NT-NCName>
MUST be used to parse the XPath expression.  (In other word, changes
made by XML 1.1 or XML 1.0 Fifth Edition are not incorporated and even
for an HTML document the same definition of C<NCName> is applied.)

If the tokenizer can't tokenize the entire input string, it MUST throw
an syntax error and abort the parsing process.

In the C<Literal> production rule, any Unicode code point
(i.e. U+0000-U+10FFFF) MUST be allowed.  (This is a willful violation
to the XPath 1.0 specification for compatibility with browsers.)
